# Personal Website

This is a simple personal website showcasing some of my projects and interests. Itâ€™s not really intended as a full resume.

You can view my projects, hobbies, and contact links on the site. It is hosted at [**oliver-w.com**](https://oliver-w.com) using Nginx on a DigitalOcean droplet. I also have email forwarding set up for **me@oliver-w.com**.

**Features:**  
- Dark mode toggle  
- Live Adelaide time  
- Sections for projects, studies, hobbies, and links

Built with plain HTML, CSS, and some JS.

## Credits

This website design was inspired by a template from **Mateo Rivas**.
