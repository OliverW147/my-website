# Oliver W – Personal Website

This is a simple personal website showcasing some of my projects and interests. It’s not really intended as a full resume.

You can view my projects, hobbies, and contact links on the site.

**Features:**  
- Dark mode toggle  
- Live Adelaide time  
- Sections for projects, studies, hobbies, and links

Built with plain HTML, CSS, and some JS.

## Credits

This website design was inspired by a template from **Mateo Rivas**.
